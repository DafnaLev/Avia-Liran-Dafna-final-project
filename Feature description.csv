Feature name,Feature type,Explanation
transgenic_line,"Categorial (Sst+, Pvalb+, Htr3a+|Vip-, Vip+, Glutametric)",A transgenic mouse line refers to a group of mice that carry a specific foreign gene (transgene) that has been artificially introduced into their genome. 
neurotransmitter,"Categorial (GABAergic, Glutamatergic)","A neurotransmitter is a chemical messenger that transmits signals between nerve cells (neurons) in the nervous system, allowing communication and coordination of various physiological and cognitive processes in the body. Here there are two types:
GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system
Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system"
reporter_status,"Categorial  (Yes,No)",Reporter is a type of genetic or molecular marker that is used to identify and study specific properties or activities of neurons. 
dendrite_type,"Categorial  (Spiny,Aspiny)","Refers to the structural classification of dendrites.
These spines are the sites of excitatory synapses while aspiny dendrites typically receive inhibitory synaptic inputs."
layer,"Categorial  (L1, L2/L3, L4, L5, L6a, L6b)",Refers to the neuron origin layer in the cortex.
